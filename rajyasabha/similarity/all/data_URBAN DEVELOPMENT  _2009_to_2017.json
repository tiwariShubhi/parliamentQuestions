(a) to (c) : It is a fact that Real Estate prices have increased over the years. The concept of cross-subsidisation of public transport using land as a source of revenue has been introduced recently. However, urban development and land use planning being the state subject, the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) advises States to adopt methods like Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Dedicated Urban Transport Fund (DUTF). The Metro based public transport systems are highly capital intensive projects and hence innovative financing like utilization of available land for revenue generation of the project is evolved. The National Urban Transport Policy, 2006 also recommend use of innovative financing methods to meet the cost of urban public transport. Suggestions have also been made for the State Governments to set up an Urban Transport Fund to meet the cost of Urban Transport. An advisory in this regard was issued by MoUD on 16.04.2014. The increase of property tax and circle rates are done by the urban Local Bodies/State Governments concerned and Ministry of Urban Development has no role on such matters. ******", "201764": "Will the Minister of URBAN DEVELOPMENT be pleased to state:(a) Whether general maintenance of CGHS Dispensary No. 76, Kali Bari Marg, New Delhi is being done by the CPWD on the pattern of other CGHS dispensaries in New Delhi;
