The Government is aware of the C&AG Report No. 3 of 2015 regarding Audit of Direct Taxes for the year ended March, 2014 wherein 469 Draft Para cases have been reported to the Ministry involving tax effect of Rs.2653.72 crore. These cases are under consideration in the Ministry. The amount of Rs. 2.2 lakh crore actually pertains to the certified demand referred to Tax Recovery Officers which is remaining uncollected in Financial Year 2013-14 as reported in para 1.10.03 of the said report. It represents the tax on income already assessed rather than any under-assessment of irregular claim of exemption.(b) Remedial action in respect of the Audit objection is being taken in respect of the objections raised by the C&AG to bring the under-assessed income to tax. In cases where audit objections of under-assessment are finally accepted, the Department evaluates the reasons for under-assessment and in cases of gross omission or commission, appropriate administrative action is taken.(c) Besides the administrative steps taken to reduce the instances of under-assessment, the Department has also in place a robust internal audit mechanism covering large number of cases to detect leakage of revenue due to under-assessment of tax. The hierarchical superior authorities are also required to inspect the assessment work of the subordinate assessing officers to monitor the work done by them with a view to preventing revenue leakage and ensuring future course correction. Further, the Department has embarked upon technological solutions where computations of income tax, levy of interest and penalty, calculation of delay, etc are done through computer system to avoid errors.

In addition, National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) which was to be withdrawn after implementation of NCIP from Rabi 2013-14, has been extended further. Improvement of Crop Insurance Schemes is a continuous process. In the 11th five year plan, the Health Insurance Scheme (HIS) was implemented for weavers by Ministry of Textiles to enable the weaver community to access healthcare facilities. The HIS provides a benefit of Rs. 15000/- per annum (out of which Rs. 7500/- is for OPD) for a family of four members. The scheme was discontinued w.e.f. 30.09.2014. However, the same scheme is being implemented by Ministry of Labour & Employment on Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) platform with enhanced benefits of Rs. 37500/- (Rs. 7500/- and Rs. 30000/- for out patient and inpatient treatment respectively) for a family of five members. Currently, the scheme has been transferred from 1st April, 2015 to Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and is being implemented by them. Ministry of Textiles has been implementing Mahatma Gandhi Bunkar Bima Yojana (MGBBY) to provide life insurance cover to handloom weavers in the case of natural death (Rs. 60,000/-), accidental death (Rs. 1,50,000/-) total disability (Rs. 1,50,000/-) and partial disability (Rs.75,000/-). In addition, scholarship of Rs. 300/- per quarter per child is available to students studying in IX to XII standard or for a maximum period of four years, whichever event occurs earlier. The benefit is restricted to two children of the member covered.(b) & (c): Actuarial premium rates are being charged under component schemes of NCIP viz. MNAIS and WBCIS, and for annual commercial/horticultural crops (cotton, sugarcane, potato etc.) under NAIS. However, flat rates of premium ranging between 1.5% to 3.5% for normal sum insured and normal indemnity level for food and oilseed crops are charged under NAIS and Rs. 9.00 to Rs. 14.00 per coconut palm under CPIS. Whereas for higher than normal sum insured and higher than normal indemnity level for food and oilseed crops, under NAIS, actuarial premium rates are charged.NCIP is an improved version of the earlier schemes and various additional features like risk coverage for pre-sowing/prevented sowing, for post harvest losses due to cyclone in coastal areas, on account payment of up to 25% of likely claims in areas suffering at least 50% crop yield loss etc. have been incorporated to make it more farmer-friendly. For the benefit of farmers, premium subsidy by the Government has also been increased upto 75% of the premium under NCIP components. All the crop insurance schemes except CPIS are compulsory for loanee farmers in the notified areas/crops as notified by the concerned State Government, and voluntary for non-loanee farmers. Claims under crop insurance schemes are worked out and settled as per the provisions of the respective scheme based on the formula for indemnity. If observed trigger value falls below or above from the notified trigger value, then claims per unit are calculated using the formula depending upon index definition under Weather Based Crop Insurance Schemes (WBCIS) and settled within 45 days from the end of risk period & receipt of weather data subject to receipt of premium subsidy from State and Central Government. On the other hand, claims under MNAIS and NAIS are worked out on the basis of yield data received from the State Government. However, a provision of on account payment of 25% of estimated claims in areas suffering at least 50% crop yield loss, and full claim in case of localized calamities and for post harvest losses due to cyclone in coastal areas are available under MNAIS. Insurance companies have been advised from time to time to settle these claims at the earliest.**************", "212317": "(a) the measures taken by the Ministry to overcome the inconveniences caused to the customers on account of consecutive holidays in the banking sector that happens very frequently; and(b) whether the Ministry would direct the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to pass instructions to both public and private sector banks to keep internet banking, mobile banking and ATM services fully active during such a prolonged holiday period?", "212316": "(a) whether people have to face a lot of problems while standing in the queue for the whole day due to heavy rush at Rohru branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) in Shimla district and the ATM facility is also in very bad shape there; and (b) if so, whether Government proposes to open a branch in Chirgaon Tehsil which is a development block of Shimla district and 27 Panchayats come under this Tehsil and the reasons for not opening a branch therein when the Government is going to open a branch of SBI at an ordinary village Kutara which is located only at the distance of seven kilometres from Shimla?", "212315": "(a) the details of loans sanctioned by urban/metropolitan and rural branches of nationalized banks and the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) under th e National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) during 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 separately to farmers under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC), bank-wise and State-wise; and(b) whether urban/metropolitan branches have sanctioned more loans than rural branches, and if so, the details thereof and the reasons for the same?", "212314": "RAJYA SABHAUNSTARRED QUESTION No. 1772TO BE ANSWERED ON TUESDAY, THE 12TH MAY, 2015Vaisakha 22, 1937 (SAKA)Dismantling of DCI1772.
